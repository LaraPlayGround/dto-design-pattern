# LaraStack - DTO Design Pattern

Welcome to LaraStack, where we explore the fascinating world of software engineering and best practices! In this topic, we will delve into the Data Transfer Object (DTO) design pattern with our lecturer, Lahiru Rajapakshe, a seasoned Software Engineer.

## What is the DTO Design Pattern?

The DTO design pattern is a powerful tool used in software development to transfer data between different layers of an application. It helps decouple data representation from business logic, simplifying data transfer and improving performance. By using DTOs, we ensure that data is efficiently shared between components without unnecessary exposure.
